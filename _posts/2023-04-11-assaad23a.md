title: Root Cause Identification for Collective Anomalies in Time Series given an
  Acyclic Summary Causal Graph with Loops
software: https://github.com/ckassaad/EasyRCA
abstract: This paper presents an approach for identifying the root causes of collective
  anomalies given observational time series and an acyclic summary causal graph which
  depicts an abstraction of causal relations present in a dynamic system at its normal
  regime. The paper first shows how the problem of root cause identification can be
  divided into many independent subproblems by grouping related anomalies using d-separation.
  Further, it shows how, under this setting, some root causes can be found directly
  from the graph and from the time of appearance of anomalies. Finally, it shows,
  how the rest of the root causes can be found by comparing direct effects in the normal
  and in the anomalous regime. To this end, an adjustment set for identifying direct
  effects is introduced. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
  datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
