title: 'Mode-Seeking Divergences: Theory and Applications to GANs'
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent a game between two neural
  network machines designed to learn the distribution of data. It is commonly observed
  that different GAN formulations and divergence/distance measures used could lead
  to considerably different performance results, especially when the data distribution
  is multi-modal. In this work, we give a theoretical characterization of the mode-seeking
  behavior of general f-divergences and Wasserstein distances, and prove a performance
  guarantee for the setting where the underlying model is a mixture of multiple symmetric
  quasiconcave distributions. This can help us understand the trade-off between the
  quality and diversity of the trained GANsâ€™ output samples. Our theoretical results
  show the mode-seeking nature of the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence over standard
  KL-divergence and Wasserstein distance measures. We subsequently demonstrate that
  a hybrid of JS-divergence and Wasserstein distance measures minimized by Lipschitz
  GANs mimics the mode-seeking behavior of the JS-divergence. We present numerical
  results showing the mode-seeking nature of the JS-divergence and its hybrid with
  the Wasserstein distance while highlighting the mode-covering properties of KL-divergence
  and Wasserstein distance measures. Our numerical experiments indicate the different
  behavior of several standard GAN formulations in application to benchmark Gaussian
  mixture and image datasets.
